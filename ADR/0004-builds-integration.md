Date: 2026-08-25

## Status

Proposed

<!-- Status lifecycle:
- Proposed: Under discussion, not yet accepted
- Accepted: Approved, ready for implementation
- Implemented: Done and reflected in the product
- Superseded: Replaced by a newer ADR (link to it)
- Rejected: Not accepted (stays in repo for reference)
-->

## Context

OpenShift Builds will cease to exist as separate product and will made available to user through OpenShift Pipelines.
This integration will install OpenShift Builds operator along with OpenShift Pipelines Operator from the user installs OpenShift Pipelines from software catalog.

### Constraints

- This will only install the OpenShift Builds Operator and user would need to create a `OpenShiftBuilds` CR to install the Build controllers.
- The OpenShift Builds operator will be installed in `openshift-operators` namespace
- The OpenShift Builds controllers will be installed in `openshift-builds` namespace
- OpenShift Builds will have separate set or roles and role bindings
- Existing forms for Builds in OpenShift UI should work as it is.

### Proposal

`operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1`, Cluster Service Version defines deployments as a list, which allows to specify multiple deployments.

```yaml
# Cluster Service Version (Builds deployment added)
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterServiceVersion
spec:
  install:
    spec:
      deployments:
        - name: tekton-operator
	    - name: tekton-operator-webhook
	    - name: openshift-builds-operator
```

Create Kustomize component `builds` under [Operator Config for OpenShift](https://github.com/tektoncd/operator/tree/main/config/openshift). The component will hold all the manifest required to deploy OpenShift Builds operator.
Include the manifest under [OperatorHub release manifests](https://github.com/tektoncd/operator/blob/main/operatorhub/openshift/manifests/fetch-strategy-release-manifest/kustomization.yaml)

User creates the following CR to install Shipwright Builds controllers and Shared resources daemonset.
```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenShiftBuild
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  sharedResource:
    state: Enabled
  shipwright:
    build:
      state: Enabled
```

### Benefits

- OpenShift Builds operator will be installed with OpenShift Pipelines Operator. Then all the components for OpenShift Builds like Shipwright, Shared Resources can in installed and used by creating the `OpenShiftBuilds` CR.


### Drawbacks

- Existing OpenShift Builds users should manually switch by uninstalling existing builds operator and creating the `OpenShiftBuilds` custom resource.
- Maintaining release would be tedious, as there's new operator being shipped with the OpenShift Pipelines Operator.
- OpenShift Builds Operator CRDs and OpenShift Pipelines Operator CRDs will have different ownership even though they are deployed using the same operator.
- If the OpenShift Builds deployment fails, install strategy will show failed for all OpenShift Pipelines Operator.


### Alternate Proposal

There's an alternate solution that provides a much better user experience and manageability for the integration but requires more code changes in the tekton operator repository.
This is uses tekton extension to add `openshift-builds` as component under tekton operator, managed by `TektonConfig`
reconciler as well as a separate `OpenShiftBuilds` CR same as the above proposal using. This would bypass all the code 
of the `Shipwright Operatpr` and `OpenShift Builds` operator and deploy the manifests directly using Tekton's extension 
framework, using `TektonInstallerSet` client. Obviously this would require all the logic from the `Shipwright` and `OpenShift Builds` operator to implemented in tekton operator repo.

Addition to operator/v1aplha1 API:
```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: OpenShiftBuild
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  enable: true
  sharedResource:
    enable: True
    # Any extra operand specific configurations 
  shipwright:
    build:
      enable: True
      # Any extra operand specific configurations 
    trigger:
      enable: True
      # Any extra operand specific configurations 
```

#### Considerations:
- Creating this `OpenShift Build` CR would by default install all the components for OpenShift Builds, `Shipwright Build`, `Shipwright Triggers` and `Shared Resource CSI Driver`.
- Under default configuration, installing `Tekton Operator` would not create this CR, instead it will be created by 
  `TektonConfig` controller on enabling `OpenShiftBuilds` under `TektonConfig`
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: TektonConfig
  metadata:
    name: cluster
  spec:
    platforms:
      openshift:
        builds:
          enable: True  
  ```
- There will be separate controller to reconcile `OpenShiftBuilds` CR and install the enabled components, in case user creates the CR by themselves.
- Configurations for `OpenShiftBuilds` defined in `TektonConfig` should be reflected in the `OpenShiftBuilds` CR created by `TektonConfig` controller.
- The controller should deploy the required Network Policies for all operands.

### Benefits

- OpenShift Builds operator will be installed as a component of Tekton Operator and all the components for OpenShift Builds like Shipwright, Shared Resources can in installed by enabling the corresponding component in `TektonConfig` and also by creating the `OpenShiftBuilds` CR.
- This approach follows the Tekton org approach of integrating addon components in tekton ecosystem.
- Unified user experience across all components by enabling OpenShift Builds from `TektonConfig`.
- No additional changes required in Release configurations.

### Drawbacks

- The whole login of `Shipwright` and `OpenShiftBuilds` operator need to implemented here. Vendoring any code from upstream `redhat-openshift-builds/operator` is not possible because the code is present in `internal` directory and is not allowed to import.
 Also, the code uses `manifestival` apply directly, which is not the approach in tekton extension framework, instead it uses `InstallerSet` client.
- Extensive testing and automated test coverage is required due to the amount of code addition. 

## Decision

TBD

## Consequences

OpenShift Builds operator will be deployed along with OpenShift Pipelines Operator. After that user can optionally create `OpenShiftBuilds` CR to install Shipwright Builds and Shared Resources


### Follow-up actions

- Migration path from existing installing process to this proposed installation process
- OpenShift Builds docs to exists as standalone or merged with OpenShift Pipelines
- The OpenShift UI forms for Shipwright exists under `Builds` section under OpenShift Console. It should be changed to dynamic console plugin and brought under OpenShift Pipelines.
